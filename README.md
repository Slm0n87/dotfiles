dotfiles
========

These are my personal configuration files. The directory structure is designed
so that you can symlink everything with a single command. This is only tested
with and only expected to work on Ubuntu.

Installation
------------

### Copypasta Installation ###

This copypasta will:

* Install a couple of prerequisites with APT.
* Install RVM and Ruby.
* Clone the repository.
* Run the `rake force` task, symlinking all config files and overwriting any
  existing files.

If you understand the risks and want to press on, copy and paste this:

```sh
sudo apt-get update && \
sudo apt-get --yes --no-install-recommends install bash curl git patch bzip2 && \
curl https://raw.github.com/justinforce/dotfiles/master/bootstrap | bash
```

### Manual Installation ###

This method won't overwrite any files and skips some cool magic stuff. This'll
just get you the content, and it's up to you to symlink what you like.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/justinforce/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles --recursive
```

Then you can `cd` into `~/.dotfiles` and run `rake -T` to get a list of the
available tasks.

Highlights
----------

I use [Vundle][] to manage plugins. I use [my fork][my zsh-git-prompt] of
[git-zsh-prompt][] to get nice git info in my prompt.
