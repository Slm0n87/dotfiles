These are my personal configuration files. The directory structure is designed
so that you can symlink everything with a single command, then just
periodically do a `git pull --recurse-submodules` in the directory to update
everything.

Just run `setup.rb` (or `ruby setup.rb`) in this directory to install the default
config files. Optionally, add a role name (such as harold, home, etc.) to
install roll-specific configuration.

The configuration files themselves are found in the `files` directory.

The tasks and files per role are found (and can be configured) in `config.yml`.

The various scripts, etc. found here are copyright their respective owners and
documentation can be found for each of them by viewing the file or googling the
product name. If I am improperly using anything here, please let me know and I
will correct the problem.
